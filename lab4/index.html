			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To describe tasks and programming using pseudocode, then to put that code in javascript and HTML.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't really have any problems beyond timing issues, as I had a busy weekend but this lab wasn't so bad, just took a bit of extra effort. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think it went well, I just wish we were a bit more coordinated about it, but I'll do better to get my partner into gear next lab.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>

					<p><pre><code>
						Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task
						Making macaroni & cheese roux style:
						Mise en place (everything in its place)
						Make sure you have all the ingredients ready (milk, butter, macaroni boxes, salt, and cheese powder)
						All cookware is clean and ready for use, and easily accessible
						Boil water
						Add salt
						Add the macaroni
						Keep the water at a boil until the macaroni is ready
						Turn the sink water on to cold and let it run down the drain during this next step
						Pour the macaroni into a strainer to remove the water
						Put butter in the pot and let it melt
						Add cheese powder (remember to fold the packets up over the pot after it is emptied to create less mess)
						Carefully pour milk into the pot, little bits at a time
						Mix the butter, milk, and cheese powder until it reaches desired consistency. Repeat step 10 as necessary to reach this consistency
						That creates the roux. Add the macaroni to the roux and stir from the bottom to coat the macaroni in the cheese roux
						Serve and enjoy </p></pre></code>

						Task 2 & 3: Pseudocode a simple computer game and turn pseudocode into comments
						// Rock Paper Scissors - Pseudocode for Lab 4.
						// Author: Parker Ehlers & Cody Proctor
						// Date: 10/22/2023
						//Pseudocode for Rock, Paper, Scissors:
						//Get all the variables: Computer choice, Player choice, and result
						//Assign each choice a number 1 = rock, 2 = paper, 3 = scissors
						//Have player choose 1, 2, or 3
						//Have computer generate a random number from 1 to 3
						//To determine the winner:
							//1. If the player’s choice is the same as the computers choice then the result is a tie.
							//2. If the player’s choice is 3 (scissors) and the computers choice is 2 (paper) the result is player wins.
							//3. If player choice is 2 (paper) and the computers choice is 1 (rock) then the result is player wins
							//4. If the player choice is 1 (rock) and the computer choice is 3 (scissors)the result is player wins
							//5. If any other combination occurs, the result is that the computer wins
						//Print result </p></pre></code>
