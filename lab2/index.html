        <h1> Hello World!</h1>
        <p>My partner has successfully made an html file and so have I!
            I am Parker Ehlers, an AGPM and Literature student at UCSC. My hobbies include reading, playing Dungeons & Dragons,
            and reading. I also really enjoy walking around the UCSC campus, since the air is so fresh and the place is so walkable. 
            I've added a large photo of a redwood below both to demonstrate my learning. 
            I could add any other photo, but redwoods are relevant to UCSC and my walking around campus.
