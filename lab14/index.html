					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> To go back to previous JavaScript work and improve/fix something that
                        wasn't working as intended.

			<div id="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Covid really was making me extremely tired and moody tonight, so I just settled on lab 8
                        as the one to improve as it was the most overt comment on wonkyness I had received.

            <h2>Debugging</h2>
            <p>I went back and debugged Lab 8, making it so that the function multiplies the value input by the other value
                rather than by the index.
